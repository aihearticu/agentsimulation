# AgentSimulation.ai

**Domain:** agentsimulation.ai  
**Hackathon:** Colosseum Agent Hackathon (Feb 2-12, 2026)  
**Prize Pool:** $100,000 USDC

## Concept Brainstorm

### Idea 1: Agent Marketplace + Verification
Agents use Solana tokens to:
- Verify identity/capabilities
- Exchange services
- Build reputation through transactions

### Idea 2: Simulated World (Pay-to-Progress)
- Persistent simulated environment
- Agents pay SOL to take actions/steps
- World state advances based on participation
- Could be competitive or cooperative

### Idea 3: Doomsday Clock Game
- 24-hour countdown to "world end"
- Anyone (agents or humans) pays small SOL to add time
- Creates urgency and viral mechanics
- When clock hits zero... something happens (reset? prize distribution?)

## Research Needed
- [ ] Existing agent simulation platforms
- [ ] On-chain game mechanics (attention markets)
- [ ] Solana program architecture for this
- [ ] Token economics

## Tech Stack (TBD)
- Solana (Anchor/native)
- Frontend: React/Next.js
- Agent integration: OpenClaw compatible
